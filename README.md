1. ''Convergence rate with different Nystrom size'' uses part of the cifar-10 dataset (30,000 data points) to compare the convergence rate with different Nystrom size s.
2. ''Convergence rate with different q (AxlePro)'' compares the convergence rate with different precondition level for AxlePro using 3000 synthetic data points.
3. ''Convergence rate with different q (LM-AxlePro)'' compares the convergence rate with different precondition level for LM-AxlePro using 3000 synthetic data points.
